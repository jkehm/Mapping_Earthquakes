# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Background
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
### Deliverables
##### Deliverable 1

The above images shows what is required for the first deliverable. A working map with two layers (one with style type Street, and the other with Satellite), additionally the earthquake data must work, as well as the tectonic plate data being added as a new layer. Both the earthquake and plate data appears when the page is called upon. Additionally, we can choose if we want the tectonic plates removed, and we can remove the Earthquake data.
##### Deliverable 2

The above image shows my result for the second deliverable. In addition the first deliverable, we have added new data of major earthquakes. Similarly, when the page is loaded we can see all three data layers, and have two options for the map tile.
##### Deliverable 3

The above images shows the third tile layer that has been added, which is the third deliverable for this assignment. Again, we can easily toggle between which data is being shown, as well as which tile layer we are showing. All of this works with no issues.
